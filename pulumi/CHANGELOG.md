# Changelog

## pulumi-2.22.3 (Alpha)

**Status:** Alpha — functional but not production-hardened.

### Features

- **Bridge scaffold** — Full `pulumi-terraform-bridge/v3` integration with `pkg/pf/tfbridge` and `pkg/pf/tfgen`.
- **54 resources + 40 data sources** — All Terraform resources and data sources bridged with auto-tokenization via `SingleModule` (token form: `flashblade:index:*`).
- **Python SDK** — Generated `pulumi_flashblade` package, installable as a wheel from GitHub Releases.
- **Go SDK** — Generated Go module at `github.com/numberly/opentofu-provider-flashblade/pulumi/sdk/go`, fetchable via `go get` with `GOPRIVATE`.
- **Cosign-signed binaries** — Multi-platform plugin archives (`linux/darwin/windows` x `amd64/arm64`) signed with keyless Sigstore.
- **Composite ID support** — Import works for all 4 composite-ID resources using `/` separator:
  - `flashblade_object_store_access_policy_rule`
  - `flashblade_bucket_access_policy_rule`
  - `flashblade_network_access_policy_rule`
  - `flashblade_management_access_policy_directory_service_role_membership`
- **Sensitive field promotion** — 7 sensitive fields are marked as Pulumi secrets (auto-promoted from TF schema + explicit overrides).
- **Soft-delete defense** — Bucket and filesystem resources inherit 30-minute delete timeout from the TF provider for two-phase destroy + eradication polling.
- **State upgrader delegation** — TF state upgraders for `flashblade_server`, `flashblade_directory_service_role`, and `flashblade_object_store_remote_credentials` are delegated through the bridge.
- **Schema drift gate** — CI enforces that `schema.json` and `bridge-metadata.json` are committed and unchanged after `make tfgen`.
- **No autonaming** — Resource names are operational identifiers; consumers must supply explicit `name` values.

### Upgrade Notes

These upgrade notes cover moving from "no Pulumi" to alpha:

1. Install the provider plugin:
   ```bash
   pulumi plugin install resource flashblade v2.22.3 --server github://api.github.com/numberly
   ```

2. Install the Python SDK:
   ```bash
   pip install https://github.com/numberly/opentofu-provider-flashblade/releases/download/pulumi-2.22.3/pulumi_flashblade-2.22.3-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

3. Or fetch the Go SDK:
   ```bash
   export GOPRIVATE="github.com/numberly/*"
   go get github.com/numberly/opentofu-provider-flashblade/pulumi/sdk/go@v2.22.3
   ```

4. Configure the provider in your Pulumi program (see `README.md` for examples).

### Known Limitations

These are the known limitations of this alpha release:

- **Write-once fields are not write-only at the SDK layer** — Secret values are encrypted in state but may still appear in SDK structs. The Write-Only Fields pattern is deferred pending SDK maturity verification.
- **No TypeScript, C#, or Java SDKs** — Scope is Python + Go only.
- **No Pulumi Registry publication** — Install via GitHub Releases only.
- **No PyPI publication** — Install the wheel from the release asset URL.
- **Bridge-level timeout overrides unavailable** — `ResourceInfo` in bridge v3.127.0 does not expose `CreateTimeout`/`UpdateTimeout`/`DeleteTimeout`. Timeouts are inherited from the TF provider shim. Use `customTimeouts` in your Pulumi program if needed.
- **ProgramTest coverage is limited to 3 resources** — `target`, `remote_credentials`, and `bucket` have examples. Full 54-resource coverage is deferred.
- **`pulumi import` round-trip tests are manual** — Composite ID ComputeID closures are unit-tested, but full `pulumi import` + `pulumi refresh` + drift-assertion tests are deferred.
- **State upgrader smoke tests are manual** — TF state upgraders are registered and delegated, but full `pulumi refresh` with pre-captured state snapshots is deferred.
