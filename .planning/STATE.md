# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** Operational teams can reliably create, update, delete, and reconcile drift on FlashBlade storage resources through Terraform with zero surprises — every plan reflects reality, every apply converges
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-26 — Roadmap created, requirements mapped to 5 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: terraform-plugin-framework over SDK/v2 — modern API, plan modifiers, diagnostics
- [Roadmap]: Three-tier testing — unit + mocked integration (CI-safe) + acceptance (real array)
- [Roadmap]: All 6 policy families in v1 — avoids click-ops fallback for ops team

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: OAuth2 grant type is non-standard (`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange`) — confirm request body format against live array before auth implementation
- [Phase 1]: Soft-delete eradication polling endpoint and poll interval not confirmed in FLASHBLADE_API.md — validate during Phase 1
- [Phase 3]: SetNestedAttribute + computed sub-field interaction in framework requires validation before first policy rule resource
- [Phase 4]: Object store access policy rule IAM schema (conditions/effects) not fully mapped — requires FLASHBLADE_API.md deep-dive during planning
- [Phase 4]: Array admin singleton DELETE semantics (reset to defaults vs. error) unconfirmed
